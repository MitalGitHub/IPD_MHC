This Ruby script was developed by Mital Pandya to facilitate access to and manipulation of data contained within the bovine Major Histocompatibility Complex Immunopolymorphism Database (MHC-IPD). The Ruby script allows the user to sort the database based on breed, serological specificity or reference, and extract the FASTA file of the alleles sorted. Any questions about the script should be sent to mpandya@uvm.edu.

Note: The user must have Bioruby installed to run the script. To install bioruby follow the instructions from this link: http://bioruby.org/
